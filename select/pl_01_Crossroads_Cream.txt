I went down to the crossroads
fell down on my knees
Down to the crossroads
fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord above for mercy
Save me if you please
I went down to the crossroads
tried to flag a ride
Down to the crossroads
tried to flag a ride
Nobody seemed to know me
everybody passed me by
<♪>
Well I'm going down to Rosedale
take my rider by my side
Going down to Rosedale
take my rider by my side
You can still barrelhouse baby
on the riverside
<♪>
Run you can run
tell my friend boy Willie Brown
You can run you can run
tell my friend boy Willie Brown
That I'm standing
at the crossroad
Babe I'm sinking down
