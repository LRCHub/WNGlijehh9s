[00:28.04] Looked at him while he laid and prayed
[00:29.51] But destiny played too deep for me to say
[00:32.09] Lil' Layzie came to me
[00:34.05] Told me if he should decease, "well, then please

[00:45.94] But He keepin' me safe and in my place
[00:47.84] Say grace to the gates we race
[00:49.39] Without a chance to face the judge
[00:50.49] Then I guess my soul won't budge
[00:51.85] Grudge, because there's no mercy for thugs
[00:53.64] Ooh, what could I do?
