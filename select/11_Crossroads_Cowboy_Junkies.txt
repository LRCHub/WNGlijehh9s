I went to the crossroads
Fell down on my knee
I asked the Lord above me for mercy
"Save Bob, if you please"

Standing, standing on the crossroad
Yeah, I try to flag a ride
Don't nobody seem to know me
Just everybody passing me by

I went down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knee
I asked the Lord above me for mercy
"Save Bob, if you please"

Standing, standing on the crossroad
I try to flag a ride
Don't nobody seem to know me
Just everybody passing me by

I'm standing on the crossroad, baby
Yeah, I think I'm sinking down
Sinking, sinking down
